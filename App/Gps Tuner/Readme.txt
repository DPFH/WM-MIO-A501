Port Splitter application

application:

Before starting GPS Tuner, please start Port Splitter and set your 
input GPS port and an output virtual port.

You are able to type the name of the input port (for example "COM4") 
into the textbox, if you could not find/configure the GPS port in the 
predefined list.

Then start GPS Tuner and set your GPS port same as Port Splitter's
virtual port.
