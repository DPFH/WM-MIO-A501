In this git, there are some Linux kernel (not working), some ROMS, some apps and other stuff. This is my research for this very old phone, i decided to share. Now I have another 
phone, so I don't continue. If you're hacking/modding the MIO A501, you might find useful stuff here. Some file are compressed with 7zip due to github's file size limit.
