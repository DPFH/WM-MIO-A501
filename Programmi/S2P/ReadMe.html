    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Changes in v1.1</span></P>
    <p>
        <span>- now Artists list shows Artist names from tags, not from folders.<BR>
            &nbsp;i.e. different albums of an artist are now not necessarily be placed under
            a same sub-folder; but the
            basic rule - a folder is an album, is remained the same.<BR>
            - added progress bar on start-up, "Refresh Library" and "Set Library".<BR>
            - added larger Play/Forward/Backward keys.<BR>
            &nbsp; If more space is needed for the play buttons, set the "Album
            Layout" to "Topmost" (Settings &gt; Appearance).<BR>
            - added option to show system taskbar (Settings &gt; Appearance).<BR>
            &nbsp; If you have installed any application (e.g. some SPB software) which allows
            to close an active program on tapping the close button on the taskbar, please add
            S2P as an exception so as to minimize it (not close it). Otherwise, S2P will not
            be restarted normally.<BR>
            - added option to assign Answer or Windows hardware key as a quit shortcut key (Settings
            &gt; Others).<BR>
            - added option to have a higher display frame rate (Settings &gt; Advanced).<BR>
            &nbsp; But suggest not to be used on slow device; and a higher display frame rate definitely consumes more
            power.<BR>
            - added support to read WMA tags from WMA files.<BR>
            - added support to read ID3 tags from AAC files.<BR>
            - added search function within individual playlist.<BR>
            - added on the playing music screen, double tap the big album to show the
            current album song list (i.e. same as tapping the 
            small list icon on the top right hand corner).<BR>
            - changed the background of the playing music screen; it shows the Album art
            when viewing the album song list.<BR>
            - changed the option "Always resume playback on start" to "On start, the playback
            will always": resume, pause or off (i.e. remember the last quit status).<BR>
            - improved ASX/M3U playlist compatibility.<BR>
            - fixed some occasions that S2P could not start normally.<BR>
            - fixed the alphabetical index bar occasionally did not work.<BR>
            - fixed the "Shuffle Album" under the Albums list did not work.<BR>
            - fixed the "Save WMP registry values" option did not work.<BR>
            - a few minor bugs fixed.</span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Operations</span></p>
<P>- Since S2P simply scans music files in your storage card, it's suggested to have your music files well organized by folders 
 (e.g. <strong>\Storage Card\Music\Artist Name\Album Name\Music title.mp3</strong>).
    And then set the library root folder (tap the bottom &quot;More&quot; &gt; &quot;Set Library", e.g. <strong>\Storage Card\Music</strong>). Otherwise the artist/album
    lists will show weird names.<BR>
- To play a song, tap the song name; to shuffle the current list, tap the &quot;Shuffle&quot;.<BR>
- To play album by album randomly, under the Albums list, tap the &quot;Shuffle Albums&quot;.<BR>
- On the music playing screen, tap the top left back button to go back to the list
    view; tap the top right icon to view the currently playing album list; swipe the
    big album pic left or right to goto the next or previous album; tap the big album art to call up the timeline.<BR>
    - Over the timeline, tap the left repeat icon to toggle the repeat function; tap
    the right shuffle
    icon to toggle the shuffle function.<BR>
    - If the currently playing music has lyrics (either embedded with USLT tag or as
    a .LRC/.TXT file with a same file name), on the music playing screen, tap a while
    the title/artist/album area to toggle the
    display of the lyrics.<BR>
    - To fast forward/backward a playback, on the music playing screen, tap &amp;
    hold the forward/backward key a while. The fast forward/backward pace can be adjusted
    through the Settings.<BR>
