        <strong>Q. How to completely uninstall S2P?<br />
        </strong>A. If you have installed S2U2, stop S2U2 first. Uninstall S2P through Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Remove Programs;
        Manually delete all files from the S2P installed folder (e.g. \Program Files\S2P);
        Use any registry editor to delete the registry tree HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\A_C\S2P. Delete the folder/files under \Application Data\S2P.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. Do I have to install S2U2 before installing S2P?<BR>
    </strong>
A. No. But if you have installed S2U2, make sure you have updated your S2U2 to 0.99p or later.
 Otherwise S2P will be stopped by S2U2.</P>
<P>
    <strong>Q. When start S2P, got a "Win32 error"?</strong><BR>
    A. You may have flashed a ROM that has some WMP related files removed. Try to download
    &amp; install the WMP-OCX-WM5-square-fix.cab (for square devices) or the WMP-OCX-fix.cab
    (for other devices).</P>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. What music files can S2P play?</strong><BR>
A. MP3, MP4, M4A, AAC, WMA & WAV.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. But MP4 &amp; M4A files cannot be played?<BR>
    </strong>A. S2P uses Windows Media Player (WMP) to playback the music files. If
    WMP on your device cannot playback these files, so as S2P.</P>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. When viewing an album of WMA/WAV files, there is no duration show?!</strong><BR>

        <strong>Q. The Songs/Artists/Album list shows incorrect Artist &amp; Album names?!<BR>
        </strong>
A. You have to organize the files into folder structure like \Storage Card\Music\Artist Name\Album Name\Music title.mp3,
 otherwise it won't be well recognized by S2P. And set the library to \Storage Card\Music.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. How to turn off the screen when playing music?</strong><BR>
A. Press the Power button or the record button.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. S2P shows weird characters for the music info?!</strong><BR>
A. Try to re-tag those info in ID3V2.4 UTF-8 format.</P>
<P>
    <strong>Q. How to have album cover shown on S2P?</strong><BR>
A. Either the music file already has cover pic embedded or you have to copy the cover file
 (either cover.jpg or folder.jpg or album*.jpg made by WMP) to the corresponding album folder.<BR>

<P>
    <strong>Q. How to have lyrics shown on S2P?<BR>
    </strong>A. Either embed the lyrics as ID3 tag USLT or save the lyrics as a separate
    .LRC or .TXT file with the file name same as the music file. On the music playing
    screen, tap the title/artist/album area to toggle the display of the lyrics.<BR>
    A. <strong>Zepiii</strong> has posted a guide on how to add lyrics to your favourite songs at <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=700808" TARGET="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=700808</a>.</P>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. Does S2P support A2DP?</strong><BR>
A. Yes, as long as your device has a proper OS.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. Does S2P support AVRCP?</strong><BR>
A. Yes, starting from v0.40.</P>
<P>
    <strong>Q. But on my device AVRCP does not control S2P?</strong><BR>
A. Please have the Bluetooth turned on &amp; paired the BT headset before starting
    S2P.<BR>
    A. It's found that some devices have the AVRCP specifically bonded with the built-in WMP.<BR>
A. For Touch Diamond/Pro/HD, if it starts WMP automatically when a BT headset is connected,
 please try the &quot;T-Back 6.5 BT Driver.cab&quot; at <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=4292847&postcount=3" TARGET="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=4292847&postcount=3</A>.<BR>
A. If that still not works &amp; if you can send A_C a spare device for testing, please contact A_C at <A HREF="http://contact.ac-s2.com" TARGET="_blank">http://contact.ac-s2.com</a>.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. Does S2P support the HTC Wired Remote Control?</strong><BR>
A. From v0.80, S2P supports this remote on HTC devices with TouchFLO 3D built-in.<BR>
A. If WMP is always started when the remote PLAY button is pressed, turn on "Override WMP for remote control". Then when S2P starts, WMP will also be activated. It's
    normal as S2P will use the WMP to get the remote key press.<BR>
    A. TFDetacher is known to make the wired remote control not work.</P>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. Why the Volume up/down keys cannot control the volume bar on S2P?<br />
        </strong>A. It's because on some devices the volume up/down keys are hosted by the
        OS or other applicaton.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. After some new music files are added or deleted from the library, S2P does not recognise the changes?!</strong><BR>
A. Go to the list view, tap &quot;More&quot; &gt; &quot;Refresh Library&quot;. It works for both situations (added or deleted files).
 But if only new folders of files are added, use &quot;Set Library&quot; will update the library faster.</P>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. Why the "Shake Action" does not work on my device?<br />
        </strong>A. The "Shake Action" currently only works on some HTC device with built-in G-Sensor. If this option is selectable, then it should work on your device. Besides,
        it only functions when the screen is turned on &amp; music is playing.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q. The system icons on the top bar do not update?!</strong><BR>
A. Yes, they only show the start status. But the battery level icon is up-to-date.
 However, they will all be alive if S2U2 v1.00 or later is running in the background.</p>
<P>
    <strong>Q. How to make S2P runs faster?</strong><BR>
A. Some tips:<BR>
- well organize the mp3 files in folders;<BR>
- keep the mp3 files small (&lt;= 256kbps);<BR>
- don't use embedded album art, use folder.jpg instead;<BR>
- keep album art small (&lt;= 200 square pixels);<BR>
- let S2P goes through every album for creating some cached files for later better performance;<BR>
- turn off "Always load embedded Album Pic";<BR>
    - don't use embedded lyrics, turn off show lyrics;<BR>
- reformat the Storage Card.</P>
