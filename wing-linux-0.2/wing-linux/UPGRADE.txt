Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

To upgrade from the 0.1 release, follow these instructions.  You'll need to be in Linux
for this.

1) Using your Linux computer, mount the Linux partition and your Windows partition on your
   SD card.  I assume your SD card is at /dev/sdb -- adjust if necessary.

   Run the following:

       # sudo mkdir -p /card/windows /card/linux
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /card/windows
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /card/linux

2) Delete all files on the Linux partition.

   You may want to back up anything important before doing this.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH
   THESE NEXT COMMANDS -- A TYPO COULD RESULT IN MASSIVE DATA LOSS!

       # cd /card/linux
       # sudo rm -rf *

3) Continue with instructions in INSTALL, starting from step 4.
