Introduction
============

Wing Linux can be installed in two ways -- run directly from your SD card without modifications,
and by partiting your SD card with a dedicated partition.

Direct from SD Installation
---------------------------

1) Copy all of the files in your wing-linux* directory to /Storage Card/linux

2) Run HaRET

3) Follow the on screen instructions.  First bootup takes a long time -- please
   be patient.

Using a Dedicated Partition
---------------------------

1) Using a Linux computer, repartition your SD card.  You need something like Partition
   Magic or some other suitable partitioner (in Linux, you can use gparted to resize your
   Windows partition.)  Use the following layout:

	Partition 1 (/dev/mmcblk0p1): Primary, FAT32 (vfat) containing your original
                                      Windows files (any size of your choosing)
	Partition 2 (/dev/mmcblk0p2): Primary, Linux Swap, 128mb
	Partition 3 (/dev/mmcblk0p3): Primary, EXT3 (Linux), at least 256mb

   I've tested this with a partition scheme of 650mb for partition 3, 1.2gb for partition 1
   and 128mb for partition 2 (on a 2gb card).

2) Format the swap and Linux partitions.

   For this you'll need a Linux computer.  Run the following (I assume your SD card is
   at /dev/sdb -- adjust if different):

       # sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2
       # sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb3

   I'm assuming the layout in step 1 as well.

3) Mount the new Linux partition and your Windows partition.

   Still from Linux, run the following:

       # sudo mkdir -p /card/windows /card/linux
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /card/windows
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /card/linux

4) Unzip the entire contents of the rootfs.tar.gz archive to your Linux partition on your
   SD card.  I'm assuming you unzipped the install archive in $HOME:

       # cd /card/linux
       # sudo tar -xzvf $HOME/wing-linux/rootfs.tar.gz
       # cd ..

5) Copy the Windows portion of the installer to the Windows partition.  Again, I assume
   you unzipped the install archive in $HOME.

       # cd /card/windows
       # sudo mkdir linux
       # sudo cp $HOME/wing-linux*/{haret-0.5.2.exe,default.txt,startup.txt,zImage} linux
       # cd ..

6) Unmount the two partitions:

       # sudo umount /card/windows
       # sudo umount /card/linux

7) (Optional) Remove the /card mountpoints

       # cd /
       # sudo rm -rf card

8) Reinstall the SD card into your phone (or reboot your phone if you used WM5Storage)

9) Configure default.txt

   === Screen Configuration ===

   Version 0.3 features a new kernel option for configuring your screen.  This is to help
   as many different configurations function with the same kernel as possible:

       heraldlcd=screen:[0|1]{,noinitdisable}

   There are two parts to this: the screen and the noinitdisable part.  For screen, you can
   choose between two configurations -- 0 or 1.  Screen 0 is used mostly in T-Mobile Wing
   hardware, though it has been known to cause white screen problems for some.  If this
   happens to you, try screen 1.

   If neither of those result in a usable display, try them both, but add the 'noinitdisable'
   flag.  This instructs the video driver not to reset the video, but instead assume it's
   already initialzed.

   If none of this results in a usable configuration, send the contents of "dispdump.txt"
   (in the folder you placed HaRet) to Cory Maccarrone <darkstar6262@gmail.com>.

   You can find this switch in your 'set CMDLINE' line in default.txt.

   An example with screen 1 and the 'noinitdisable' flag:

       heraldlcd=screen:1,noinitdisable


   === System Runlevel ===

   The Linux system supports booting into three different modes -- Android, GPE, and
   text console.  The default.txt file that comes with your distribution is preconfigured
   to boot into Android.  To modify this, find the line:

       set CMDLINE "debug quiet psplash=false loglevel=7 root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 init=/sbin/init console=tty0 video=omapfb:accel heraldlcd=screen:0 4"

   The last number, '4', is the important one:

       5 --> Text console
       4 --> Android

   Once you're done, save and quit.

   ======================================================================================
   NOTE FOR ANDROID: The keyboard and buttons are not functioning enough to allow Android
   to reboot your phone properly.  As such, if you want to reboot, either use the reset
   button to soft reset, or log in through USB and run "reboot".
   ======================================================================================

10) Start haret-0.5.2.exe from the wing-linux folder on your storage card.

    At this point, Linux should boot.  If all went well, you should see the main interface
    (Android or text console).

11) (Optional) Plug in a USB cord to SSH into the phone.

    If you'd like to control the phone from another computer, plug in a USB cord to it
    and configure your usb0 device (from Linux) as follows:

       # sudo ifconfig usb0 10.100.0.2 up

    Ubuntu users may have to run this several times before it takes effect.

    Now you can ssh into the phone as follows:

       # ssh root@10.100.0.1

    The password is "wing".

Running Programs
----------------

If you booted into text console, you can still start Android from either SSH over USB or
through the text console interface.

  * From the text or SSH console, type:

       # startAndroid

To reboot your phone, run:

       # reboot
