Upgrade Instructions - Direct from SD
-------------------------------------

To upgrade, simply remove all contents of your /Storage Card/linux folder, then follow the
INSTALL instructions.

Note that anything you've added since installing will be erased -- be sure to back up anything
important.


Upgrade Instructions - Dedicated Partition
------------------------------------------

To upgrade from a previous release, follow these instructions.  You'll need to be in Linux
for this.

1) Using your Linux computer, mount the Linux partition and your Windows partition on your
   SD card.  I assume your SD card is at /dev/sdb -- adjust if necessary.

   Run the following:

       # sudo mkdir -p /card/windows /card/linux
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /card/windows
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /card/linux

2) Delete all files on the Linux partition.

   You may want to back up anything important before doing this.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH
   THESE NEXT COMMANDS -- A TYPO COULD RESULT IN MASSIVE DATA LOSS!

       # cd /card/linux
       # sudo rm -rf *

3) Continue with instructions in INSTALL, starting from step 4.
