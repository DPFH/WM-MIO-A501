Android for and only for Asus P535

Based on Google Anroid SDK 1.0, with LCD, Keypad and Touchscreen working properly. 

1. Prepare a spare SD card, format it as EXT2 file system
2. Extract all files from rootfs.tar.gz to the SD card
3. Copy other files into any directory in the internal flash memory of your P535
4. Plug in the SD card
5. Run file "haret-0.5.2.exe"
6. Enjoy!

If not running properly, it might be caused by incorrect device name for the SD card. 
Check the booting information on the LCD screen, some characters as following should be displayed:

[  1.000020]b300    975360 mmcblk0 driver: mmcblk
[  1.002520]  b301    975359 mmcblk0p1

The "mmcblk0p1" is just the correct device name of the SD card. The ending character in the string may also be some other number other than "1".
Open the file "startup.txt" with text editor and modify the line:  

set CMDLINE "debug rootdelay=3 root=/dev/mmcblk0 init=/android.sh mem=64M"

to:

set CMDLINE "debug rootdelay=3 root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 init=/android.sh mem=64M"

Then run it again!
