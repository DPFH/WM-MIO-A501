Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1) Using a Linux computer, repartition your SD card.  You need something like Partition
   Magic or some other suitable partitioner (in Linux, you can use gparted to resize your
   Windows partition.)  Use the following layout:

	Partition 1 (/dev/mmcblk0p1): Primary, FAT32 (vfat) containing your original
                                      Windows files (any size of your choosing)
	Partition 2 (/dev/mmcblk0p2): Primary, Linux Swap, 128mb
	Partition 3 (/dev/mmcblk0p3): Primary, EXT3 (Linux), at least 256mb

   I've tested this with a partition scheme of 650mb for partition 3, 1.2gb for partition 1
   and 128mb for partition 2 (on a 2gb card).

2) Format the swap and Linux partitions.

   For this you'll need a Linux computer.  Run the following (I assume your SD card is
   at /dev/sdb -- adjust if different):

       # sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2
       # sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb3

   I'm assuming the layout in step 1 as well.

3) Mount the new Linux partition and your Windows partition.

   Still from Linux, run the following:

       # sudo mkdir -p /card/windows /card/linux
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /card/windows
       # sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /card/linux

4) Unzip the entire contents of the rootfs.tar.bz2 archive to your Linux partition on your
   SD card.  I'm assuming you unzipped the install archive in $HOME:

       # cd /card/linux
       # sudo tar -xjvf $HOME/wing-linux/rootfs.tar.bz2
       # cd ..

5) Copy the Windows portion of the installer to the Windows partition.  Again, I assume
   you unzipped the install archive in $HOME.

       # cd /card/windows
       # sudo mkdir wing-linux
       # sudo cp $HOME/wing-linux/{haret.exe,default.txt,zImage6} wing-linux
       # cd ..

6) Unmount the two partitions:

       # sudo umount /card/windows
       # sudo umount /card/linux

7) (Optional) Remove the /card mountpoints

       # cd /
       # sudo rm -rf card

8) Reinstall the SD card into your phone (or reboot your phone if you used WM5Storage)

9) Start HaRet.exe from the wing-linux folder on your storage card.

   At this point, Linux should boot.  If all went well, it will ask for a username
   and password:

       Username: root
       Password: wing

10) (Optional) Plug in a USB cord to SSH into the phone.

    If you'd like to control the phone from another computer, plug in a USB cord to it
    and configure your usb0 device (from Linux) as follows:

       # sudo ifconfig usb0 10.100.0.2 up

    Now you can ssh into the phone as follows:

       # ssh root@10.100.0.1

    Use the same username and password as above.


Running Programs
----------------

At this point, you can start Android or X Windows:

  * To start Android, run:

       # start_android

  * To start X-Windows, run:

       # startx

  * To reboot, run:

       # reboot
