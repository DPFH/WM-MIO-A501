Introduction
============

Wing Linux is designed to be run directly from your storage card -- no need for repartitioning
or complex installation.

Installation
------------

    1) Download the latest Wing Linux CAB file

    2) Install it to your phone (either directly or using ActiveSync)

    3) Click on Start -> Programs -> Wing Linux to start

    4) Follow the on screen instructions.  First bootup takes a long time -- please
       be patient.

If you encounter screen problems, skip to step 9 under the dedicated partition guide below.

Once your system is booted, you can follow step 11 below to connect to your phone via USB.


Logging In Remotely
-------------------

If you'd like to control the phone from another computer, plug in a USB cord to it
and configure your usb0 device (from Linux) as follows:

   # sudo ifconfig usb0 10.100.0.2 up

Ubuntu users may have to run this several times before it takes effect.

Now you can ssh into the phone as follows:

   # ssh root@10.100.0.1

The password is "wing".


Troubleshooting
---------------

Q: When I boot, I see a lot of scrolling text, then my screen fades to white and appears
   to freeze.

A: Wing Linux features the ability to auto-detect screen configuration at bootup.  But,
   this doesn't work for everyone, so new kernel options for configuring your screen are
   provided:

       heraldlcd=screen:[0|1]{,noinitdisable}

          or

       heraldlcd=custscreen,xres:<num>,yres:<num>,hfp:<num>,hbp:<num>,hsw:<num>,vfp:<num>,vbp:<num>,vsw:<num>,ivs:[0|1],ihs:[0|1],ipc:[0|1],pixelclock:<num>

   These options can be placed in the "/Storage Card/linux/default.txt" file at the end of
   the line that starts "set CMDLINE".

   The first of the two forms allows you to choose between two predefined screen configurations.
   Optionally you can also disable some initialization code that causes problems for some.

   There are two parts to this: the screen and the noinitdisable part.  For screen, you can
   choose between two configurations -- 0 or 1.  Screen 0 is used mostly in T-Mobile Wing
   hardware, though it has been known to cause white screen problems for some.  If this
   happens to you, try screen 1.

   If neither of those result in a usable display, try them both, but add the 'noinitdisable'
   flag.  This instructs the video driver not to reset the video, but instead assume it's
   already initialzed.

   If none of this results in a usable configuration, this is where the second form of the
   options comes in.  This form allows you to explicity set the video timing parameters:

       xres = Resolution of the screen in the X dimension
       yres = Reoslution of the screen in the Y direction
       hfp  = Horizontal front porch
       hbp  = Horizontal back porch
       hsw  = Horizontal scan width
       vfp  = Vertical front porch
       vbp  = Vertical back porch
       vsw  = Vertical scan width
       ivs  = Inverted vertical scan (1 = yes, 0 = no)
       ihs  = Inverted horizontal scan (1 = yes, 0 = no)
       ipc  = Inverted pixel clock (1 = yes, 0 = no)
       pixelclock = Clock rate of each dot
