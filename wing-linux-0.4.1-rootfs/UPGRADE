Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

To upgrade, simply uninstall Wing Linux from your phone like any other program.  You will also
need to remove the /Storage Card/linux directory.  Note that any user data you created in previous
versions will be lost.

If you are upgrading from previous partitioned installs, no work is needed -- simply install the
CAB file according to the installation instructions.  At bootup, you'll be presented with a menu
allowing you to boot either from the new Wing Linux installation or your existing partition.
